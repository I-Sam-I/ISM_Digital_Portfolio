                This past week, I have been focused on designing my original work and creating a budget sheet for all the needed parts. However, I have been hesitant to decide whether to develop a linkage-based mechanism, a tendon-based mechanism, or a combination of both, as they both seem appropriate for my goals and meet my basic requirements. A linkage mechanism is where each joint (knuckle in a finger) is interconnected with the other joints, so powering one joint would move the others in relation to this one. Implementing a linkage mechanism reduces the overall cost as it requires fewer actuators (motors/servos) and is also optimal for grasping objects as it mimics a human hand closing around an object. However, a few disadvantages of this is that it limits the flexibility of the finger as it has only one degree of freedom (DOF), even if it may look like it has multiple. Alternatively, the tendon-based mechanism is superior as it mimics the muscles and tendons in human fingers. Typically, there is one tendon per joint, which offers multiple DOFs and allows for dexterous movements. However, this requires numerous actuators per finger and precise tendon tensioning, which also tends to weaken over time and use. Thus, to combat this indecision, I plan on designing, 3D printing, and testing both mechanisms on two fingers to see which is appropriate for my motives. Additionally, I plan on developing one where I combine these two mechanisms into one finger, similar to the MCR II robotic hand and the ILDA robotic hand.

            <div class="card-text collapse-content">
                During the last couple of weeks, I have been busy emailing and calling cold and warm contacts for information interviews about Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, and all its related components. To overcome my fear of meeting new people, I contacted my warm contacts and successfully scheduled three interviews! I discussed my experience and weaknesses with the first meeting in my previous blog. The following two interviews went more smoothly as I did not stick to the script as strictly as I had previously. The second interview was about robotics in the big picture, as I discussed the different motors, control systems, subsystems, and various design aspects. I learned that my interviewee had attempted a similar project with his friend decades ago, so he had a lot of insightful advice. I plan on having another meeting with him about more specific things. The last interview was with a recent college graduate who got hired at META as a software engineer in a machine learning team. I asked him questions about my robotic arm in general and discussed the AI aspects of this project. I learned that he, too, had done robotics in high school and had a lot of insight. Unfortunately, I did not receive any connections from them, so I must continue sending cold emails and calls to professionals. These interviews have taught me to avoid sticking to the script and keep the conversation flowing as that allows them to talk more about their experiences, which could reveal an aspect of their profession or experiences that open the door for more direct questions.

                During the last two weeks, I finalized my original work, which is like a stepping stone for my final project. My original work will be a 3D model of my robotic hand with a budget sheet and evidence of prototyping and testing the design. I will model my product using CAD software called Fusing 360 because I have experience with it, and it is industry-standard software. Alongside researching for my original work, I also reached out into the professional world and contacted professionals in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). I learned how to formally ask a random person for an informational interview and generate topic-specific questions depending on the professional. I have also learned to maintain a list of contacts and log all my conversations with them in a spreadsheet. So far, I have taken an interview and have two more scheduled interviews. I observed some mistakes I had made during the first interview, such as not organizing my questions correctly. I had also wrapped the interview too quickly without asking if he had any questions for me. Moreover, since I had known what major he was pursuing, I had to tailor my questions to more general topics and things I knew he understood. However, I did not ask any new questions on the spot when I learned about his major. I will rectify (hopefully) these mistakes during my following interviews.

                I had an excellent opportunity to practice the interviewing and networking skills I recently learned in a professional setting: The ISM Professional Symposium. The ISM Professional Symposium is an annual event that introduces all ISM students to the professional world through networking and mock interviews. This event is instrumental in developing the soft skills that ISM strives to instill in its students. It enables them to practice amongst themselves and with professionals in various fields. I struggled at first to bring myself to talk with the experienced professionals, but I overcame this fear by approaching them with two to three of my friends. This way, we could converse with the professional without me being the sole bearer.
                <br>
                Moreover, I did not anticipate the possibility that I would be mock-interviewed by someone interested in a profession other than mine, so I did not have any open questions to ask them, which led to my poor performance, as evidenced by the feedback I received. However, as the day progressed, I brainstormed some questions I could ask anyone and even solidified my responses to common questions I encountered in my student networking session. This led me to have a fantastic interview that I enjoyed tremendously at the end of the day. The professional and I discussed my future pathway to my desired career and how best to go about it. He provided some hard-earned insight he gained from his life experiences and advised me that college is not needed; if an opportunity presents itself to be better than college, I should take it, given I properly consider my choices.

                After officially and professionally proposing my topic to my ISM teacher, we learned about making new connections and generating interview questions. I proposed my topic about a robotic tactile hand that can autonomously grip objects based on calculated points using computer vision and AI/ML. This would allow me to combine my interests in computer science and robotics alongside more minor electronics, math, and physics passions. This past week, we learned about networking. We learned how to find contacts daily, like hearing a conversation and politely introducing ourselves. We even listed multiple questions about our specific topics that we will use in our inevitable informational interviews later. I learned that generic questions that can be answered with a simple yes and no are usually viewed as too simple and a waste of time for the interviewee because I could just google it. So, I had to come up with questions that would help me understand more about my topic and give me guidance in my journey. Moreover, to expand our networks further, we finalized our resumes and printed them out to give out at our upcoming symposium (more about that in the next blog post). Finally, I got to practice all these skills we learned in our classes during the AI and Engineering meetups that ISM 2 students hosted to help new ISM students understand their topic. These sessions allowed me to practice my communication skills with fellow students and even mentors who were there to provide very informative speeches.

                After narrowing down my topic to a specific area under robotics, I researched deeply into Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven Robotics and cybernetics alongside computer vision and object detection. I learned about searching for credible sources and creating an annotated bibliography for each of my sources. More specifically, I learned that peer-reviewed sources and sources from the government are highly reliable. Moreover, I also learned how to gain more information about the authors of my sources to further credibly the source. This research taught me about the specific implementation and the hardware required to build a potential robot. For example, I can use a three-dimensional vision system to track an object in three dimensions, followed by a multiple-degree of freedom arm (DOF) with a claw or hand gripping it. However, I still have multiple questions about the particular details and the viability of 3D printing the parts to reduce the budget. I aim to ask these questions in an informational interview with a professional in the robotics or AI field.

                On the other hand, I attended the ISM Engineering and Architecture meet-up at Frisco UNT, where we had multiple fabulous speakers who knew much about biomedical engineering and architecture. This helped me expand my point of view, as some biomedical products incorporate robotics and computer vision to aid the surgeon quickly and safely. Additionally, the architecture speaker expanded my knowledge of designing and planning a product. So, this past week has been highly educational and resourceful for my topic, AI-driven robotics.

                After learning about professional dressing and the ins and outs of ISM, I had to narrow down my topic to research it. To accomplish this, I had conferences with my ISM teacher, Ms. Naegle, to help me find an exciting topic. However, I am still not satisfied with my selection. I want a topic that combines my interests in CS and robotics while still being relevant to the real world. Lately, I have been thinking more about the autonomous robotics side of things, where robots do tasks without much human input, like a self-driving car or an automatic cook bot. But those feel it is too grand of a task for ISM and would require a hefty amount of funding. Therefore, I explored similar areas and developed an autonomous navigation system with real-time mapping of the environment, which can be applied to many frontiers, such as ocean exploration or an automatic lawn mower. Moreover, I am interested in making a robotic tactile hand with object detection that can grasp irregular objects and do tasks with them; this can be applied to industrial automation and prosthetics or be used to help people with difficulty in everyday tasks. I will spend this week deciding on one of them, with the approval of Ms. Naegle, and begin researching that!

                The first weeks of Independent Study and Mentorship (ISM) were challenging and rigorous regarding the study materials and research. We, ISM students, learned a lot about professionalism and researching a specific topic. For instance, we learned how to dress professionally and business casually. Moreover, I grew my knowledge on how to properly research my topic (more on my topic later) by utilizing credible sources and avoiding plagiarism or warping the meaning of evidence. Additionally, I attended my first ISM-related professional meeting. ISM II students managed this meet-up at the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA) to bring together ISM students interested in pursuing a career in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML). This meeting was informative and beneficial as I met many students with varying ideas for applying AI to their projects. I expanded my professional network and learned more about my particular topic using this opportunity. I am interested in pursuing a career in robotics, so I wish to develop a project related to robotics that combines my knowledge of computer science (CS) and engineering. However, I will have to spend time diving deeper into my specific interests in the coming weeks and developing a project idea. Currently, I plan on either building a mechanical arm that can follow a human arm in 3D space using computer vision and AI/ML or instead, I might develop software that can interpret American Sign Language (ASL) through computer vision and AI/ML.
